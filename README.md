## Introduction

The **Car Price Prediction** application helps users estimate the price of used cars by analyzing various features such as brand, model, year of purchase, fuel type, and kilometers driven. This tool is designed for anyone interested in the automotive market, whether you are a buyer, seller, or enthusiast. 

The application employs a Linear Regression model, which is a fundamental technique in machine learning. It provides a simple yet effective way to make predictions based on historical data. The user interface is built with Flask, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers a clean and simple web interface.
- **Price Prediction**: Users can input car details to receive an estimated price.
- **Data Analysis**: The application utilizes data analysis techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Responsive Design**: The web application is designed to work on various devices.
- **Model Training**: Users can see how the model learns from data over time.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the application.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for data exploration and model training.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning, specifically for implementing the Linear Regression model.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyber220/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow these steps to make predictions:

1. **Input Car Details**: Fill in the required fields, including brand, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.
2. **Submit**: Click the "Predict Price" button.
3. **View Results**: The predicted price will display on the screen.

Feel free to experiment with different inputs to see how the model responds.

## How It Works

The application uses a Linear Regression model to predict car prices. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection**: Historical data on car prices and features is collected.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: The Linear Regression model is trained using the processed data.
4. **Prediction**: When users input car details, the model predicts the price based on learned patterns.

This approach allows for accurate and reliable price estimates.
